# Aman Arora
I am a Data Scientist at [CoreLogic Australia](https://www.corelogic.com.au/) where I spend a lot of my time building SOTA algorithms to predict house and rental prices across all of Australia and NZ. 

I have a passion for deep learning, thanks to [Jeremy Howard](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward) who made it possible for me through fast.ai to begin my journey in this space around 2 years ago.

I am self taught, and an ardent follower of the fast.ai course. Through this course itself, I have been able to pickup Python and it has made possible for me to do my own research. 

I fimly believe in giving back to the community and in that attempt, also run a meetup group called [Applied Data Science](https://www.meetup.com/Applied-Data-Science-Sydney/). This blog is also a part of me wanting to give back. Here, I attempt to write and explain what I have learnt in detail so that someone reading this doesn't have to go through the same pains. 

If you feel that any of these ideas can be expressed in a better way, I am very happy to receive constructive feedback. Please feel free to reach out to me via [twitter](https://twitter.com/amaarora) or my [email](aman.arora@corelogic.com.au).
