# About
I am a Data Scientist at [CoreLogic Australia](https://www.corelogic.com.au/) where I spend a lot of my time building SOTA algorithms to predict house and rental prices across all of Australia and NZ. 

I have a passion for deep learning, thanks to [Jeremy Howard](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward) who made it possible for me through [fast.ai](fast.ai) to begin my journey in this space around 1.5 years ago.

I am self taught, and an ardent follower of and small contributor to the [fast.ai](fast.ai) course. Through this course itself, I have been able to pickup Python and it has made possible for me to do my own research. Something, I would have not thought of being able to do when I started. 

I fimly believe in giving back to the community and in that attempt, also run a meetup group called [Applied Data Science](https://www.meetup.com/Applied-Data-Science-Sydney/). This blog is also a part of me wanting to give back. Here, I attempt to write and explain what I have learnt in detail so that someone reading this doesn't have to go through the same pain. The focus in this blog is on writing code as much as it is on explaining the concept in theory. 

If you feel that any of these ideas can be expressed in a better way, I am very happy to receive constructive feedback. Please feel free to reach out to me via [twitter](https://twitter.com/amaarora) or my [email](aman.arora@corelogic.com.au).
